# Universal Event System (Signals)

This document defines the full event system design: subscribe, publish, capture, save, reference, and trigger automations. Events are called **Signals** in the UI vocabulary (see `docs/universal-matrix.md` Naming/UX Vocabulary).

The event system fits into the universal config contract (`config/universal.toml`) as the `[events.*]` section and is the nervous system connecting all reactive workflows (`docs/reactive-workflows.md`).

## Current State

| What Exists | Where | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 event in config | `universal.toml` → `[events.routeChanged]` | Only 1 of ~40+ needed |
| 4 hard-coded events | `src/shared/contracts/ipc.ts` → `IPC_EVENTS` | Not config-driven |
| Basic pub/sub | `webview-ipc.ts` → `Map<string, Set<IpcHandler>>` | No persistence, no patterns, no middleware |
| IPC envelope | `IpcEnvelope` with `kind: "event"` | No metadata (timestamp, source, correlation) |
| Automation discovery | Reads TOML + SQLite | No event-based triggering |
| Universal URL scheme | `app://<appId>/<kind>/<target>` | No `event` kind for referencing events |

## Event Shape

Every event in the system follows one schema:

```typescript
type AppEvent = {
  id: string;              // Unique event ID (nanoid or uuid)
  name: string;            // Fully qualified name: "atlassian.triage.completed"
  category: EventCategory; // Top-level grouping
  timestamp: number;       // Unix ms
  source: EventSource;     // Where it originated
  correlationId?: string;  // Links related events (triage.started → triage.completed)
  payload?: unknown;       // Event-specific data
  meta?: {
    stage?: string;        // Lifecycle stage when event fired
    route?: string;        // Current route when event fired
    workflowId?: string;   // If triggered by a workflow
    automationId?: string; // If triggered by an automation
  };
};

type EventCategory =
  | "app"        // Application lifecycle
  | "route"      // Navigation
  | "ui"         // User interactions
  | "issue"      // Jira domain
  | "triage"     // Triage workflow
  | "pr"         // Pull requests
  | "branch"     // Git operations
  | "build"      // Build/CI
  | "automation" // Automation lifecycle
  | "state"      // State persistence
  | "sprint"     // Sprint lifecycle
  | "timer"      // Time-based signals
  | "system";    // Extension/webview system

type EventSource =
  | "extension"  // Extension host
  | "webview"    // Webview UI
  | "automation" // Automation runner
  | "external"   // Webhook or external system
  | "git"        // Git hooks
  | "timer";     // Internal clock
```

## Event × Matrix Interaction Map

How events interact with every other matrix in the universal contract:

| Matrix | How Events Interact | Direction | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity** | Events are namespaced (`atlassian.triage.completed`) | Events use namespace | `atlassian.*` prefix |
| **Actions** | Actions emit events on execution | Actions → Events | `atlassian.app.open` → `app.opened` |
| **Commands** | Commands can trigger events; events can trigger commands | Bidirectional | `atlassian.openApp` → `app.activated` |
| **Routes** | Route changes emit events; events can trigger navigation | Bidirectional | `route.changed`, `branch.switched` → navigate |
| **Views** | Events cause view re-renders via state updates | Events → Views | `triage.completed` → Plan daily re-renders |
| **Objects** | Domain object changes emit events | Objects → Events | Issue status change → `issue.transitioned` |
| **Datasets** | Dataset refreshes emit events; events trigger dataset fetches | Bidirectional | `sprint.started` → refresh sprint issues |
| **Storage** | Events persist to event store; state writes emit events | Bidirectional | `state.written`, capture to SQLite |
| **Rules** | Rules gate event handling (e.g., only if connected) | Rules → Events | `auth-required` rule gates `triage.started` |
| **Rulesets** | Rulesets bundle rules that apply to event categories | Rulesets → Events | `capture-policy` ruleset |
| **Platforms** | Platform determines transport for events | Platforms → Events | VS Code: postMessage, Web: WebSocket |
| **Environments** | Environment affects capture policy (dev=JSONL, prod=SQLite) | Environments → Events | Dev: verbose capture, Prod: selective |
| **Transport** | Events flow through IPC envelope (`kind: "event"`) | Transport carries Events | Same envelope, different wire |
| **Workflows** | Workflows subscribe to events as triggers | Events → Workflows | `pr.opened` → pr-risk-scan workflow |
| **Automations** | Automations emit lifecycle events; events trigger automations | Bidirectional | `automation.completed` → chain next |

## Universal URL for Events

Events are referenceable via the canonical `app://` URL scheme:

```
app://atlassian/event/<eventName>
app://atlassian/event/triage.completed
app://atlassian/event/pr.opened?after=2026-02-06
app://atlassian/events?category=triage&after=2026-02-06
```

| Kind | URL Pattern | Resolves To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single event definition | `app://atlassian/event/triage.completed` | Event catalog entry in Registry |
| Event log query | `app://atlassian/events?category=triage` | Filtered event log in Observe stage |
| Live subscription | `app://atlassian/events/live?pattern=triage.*` | Live event stream (firehose filtered) |

Transport wrappers:
- VS Code: `${uriScheme}://${extensionId}/app/atlassian/event/triage.completed`
- Browser: `http://localhost:5173/#/app/atlassian/event/triage.completed`

## Event Bus Operations

Five operations, all fitting through the IPC envelope:

| Operation | Description | Direction | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **publish** | Fire an event | Any → Bus | Optional (capture flag) |
| **subscribe** | Listen to events matching a pattern | Bus → Handler | — |
| **capture** | Store event in event log | Bus → Store | Always |
| **query** | Read stored events by filter | Store → Caller | — |
| **replay** | Re-emit stored events for catch-up | Store → Bus | — |

### Subscribe Patterns

Subscriptions use glob patterns on event names:

| Pattern | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `triage.*` | `triage.started`, `triage.completed`, `triage.stale` |
| `*.completed` | `triage.completed`, `build.completed`, `automation.completed` |
| `pr.*` | All PR events |
| `*` | Everything (firehose) |
| `issue.transitioned` | Exact match only |

### Capture Policy

Not all events need persistence. The config defines capture policy per category:

```toml
[events.capture]
# Which categories to persist to the event log
persist = ["triage", "automation", "state", "sprint", "pr", "issue", "build", "branch", "system"]
# Which to fire-and-forget (high frequency, low value for replay)
transient = ["ui", "route", "timer", "app"]
# Retention
maxAge = "7d"
maxCount = 5000
```

### Event Store

| Option | Format | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `_agents/events.jsonl` | Append-only JSONL | Inspectable, simple, git-diffable | No indexing, slow queries |
| SQLite (`_agents/events.db`) | Relational | Fast queries, indexed | Binary, needs driver |
| In-memory + periodic flush | Hybrid | Fast writes | Lost on crash |

Recommended: **SQLite** for production, **JSONL** for development/debugging. Config selects:

```toml
[events.store]
kind = "sqlite"          # "sqlite" | "jsonl" | "memory"
path = "_agents/events"  # Relative to workspace root
```

```

## How It Connects to the IPC Envelope

The existing envelope already supports events:

```typescript
{ kind: "event"; name: string; payload?: unknown }
```

The event system extends this with metadata without breaking the envelope:

```typescript
// Current — unchanged
type IpcEnvelope =
  | { kind: "rpc"; payload: string }
  | { kind: "event"; name: string; payload?: unknown }
  | { kind: "command"; name: string; payload?: unknown };

// New — event payload wraps AppEvent when using the event bus
// The envelope carries it; the bus unpacks and routes it
type EventEnvelopePayload = AppEvent;
```

Events published through the bus get the full `AppEvent` shape. Events sent raw through IPC (legacy) get wrapped with defaults (timestamp = now, source = sender, id = generated).

## Automation Trigger Integration

Workflows subscribe to events instead of (or in addition to) schedules:

```toml
[workflow.pr-risk-scan]
trigger = { event = "pr.opened" }

[workflow.daily-triage]
trigger = [
  { schedule = "FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9" },
  { event = "app.opened", condition = "triage.stale > 1h" },
]

[workflow.context-restore]
trigger = { event = "branch.switched" }

[workflow.sprint-planning]
trigger = { event = "sprint.started" }

[workflow.weekly-summary]
trigger = [
  { event = "sprint.ended" },
  { schedule = "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR;BYHOUR=17" },
]

[workflow.re-triage]
trigger = { event = "issue.transitioned" }

[workflow.ship-readiness]
trigger = { event = "pr.merged", condition = "allChecksGreen" }
```

The automation runner evaluates:
1. Event fires → check subscribed workflows → evaluate conditions → execute if met
2. Schedule fires → same flow
3. Chain fires (workflow.completed event) → same flow

                           └─────────────┘
```

## Query API

Stored events are queryable for dashboards, debugging, and feedback loops:

| Query | Use Case | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| By name | "Show all triage events" | `{ name: "triage.*" }` |
| By time range | "Events in the last hour" | `{ after: Date.now() - 3600000 }` |
| By correlation | "All events in this workflow run" | `{ correlationId: "abc-123" }` |
| By category | "All sprint events" | `{ category: "sprint" }` |
| By source | "All external events" | `{ source: "external" }` |
| Count by name | "How many triages this week" | `{ name: "triage.completed", after: weekStart, mode: "count" }` |

This powers:
- **Observe stage**: event timeline, event counts, pattern detection
- **Feedback loops**: "How many times did we re-triage this sprint?" → suggests auto-triage
- **Adaptation**: confirmation rates, skip rates, usage patterns
- **Debugging**: "What happened before this error?"

## Muscle Memory Integration

Events are invisible to the user. The user interacts with **stages, lists, and actions**. Events flow underneath:

| User Action | Event Published | Automation Triggered | User Sees |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opens app | `app.opened` | Load triage (if stale) | NOW/NEXT/WAITING populated |
| Clicks Run Triage | `triage.started` → `triage.completed` | Daily focus regenerates (chain) | Buckets update, focus summary appears |
| Switches branch | `branch.switched` | Context restore | Linked issue auto-displayed |
| PR merged (background) | `pr.merged` | Ship readiness check | Ship page shows "Ready" |
| Friday 5pm | `timer.ritual` | Weekly summary | Weekly tab shows summary |

The event system is the nervous system. The UI is the skin. The user touches the skin; the nervous system handles the rest.

## Registry UI Integration

The System > Registry page should show:
- **Event catalog**: all registered events with name, category, source, capture policy
- **Live event stream**: real-time feed of recent events (firehose or filtered)
- **Event counts**: per-category counts for the current session/day/week
- **Subscription map**: which workflows subscribe to which events
- **Event log query**: search stored events by name, time, correlation
