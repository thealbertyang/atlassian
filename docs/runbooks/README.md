# Runbooks

Runbooks are executable documentation. The Markdown is the source of truth and the commands are run directly from code blocks.

**How To Run**

```sh
node scripts/runbook.mjs docs/runbooks/<runbook>.md --list
node scripts/runbook.mjs docs/runbooks/<runbook>.md --block <name>
node scripts/runbook.mjs docs/runbooks/<runbook>.md --block <name> --dry-run
```
